All the textures are in the textures folder

Run the sort.py to remove unusable textures (like non squared textures, block with withe in it (like flowers))

Then place your images in the data folder (any format)

Run the script and get your results in the output folder !


If you wanna improve the script don't hesitate to text me on discord : thr.emilien


PS1: The script is not very efficient and can be improved. So for a large photo it can take ~1m30
